### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you are a recruiter or tech lead, and you are here to get an idea of what kind of code I write, I think [SRT-Player](https://github.com/Shenmin-Z/srt-player) is a good example.

SRT-Player is a tool I developed to help myself learn Japanese. Its main feature is a separate subtitle and a waveform, which is like a zoomed-in progress bar. It has a fair amount of code and a long enough maintenance history, which should represent my coding style. It's rewritten in React, and dependence on third-party libraries has been deliberately limited. For example, the drag and drop part and the waveform part, despite their complexity, are purely hand-written. It's a front-end-only project, and you can try it [here](https://shenmin-z.github.io/srt-player/).
